# GUIDELINES FOR CHECKING SOLUTIONS:
- Please solve the problem on your own first.
- If you get stuck you can check your notes first to brush up on the topics.
- In case of a Logical problem, work it out using paper and pencil, and try coding after building proper logic.
- If you are still stuck then you may check the solution Code.
## Cheers!!
